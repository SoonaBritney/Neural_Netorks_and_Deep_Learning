Neural networks and Deep Learning


## Challenge Overview
We received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received various amounts of funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Objectives
#### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
#### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
#### Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
#### Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)


Import and characterize the input data.

What variable(s) are considered the target for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither and should be removed from the input data?
Preprocess all numerical and categorical variables.

Combine rare categorical values via bucketing.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Standardize numerical variables using TensorFlow’s StandardScaler class.
Using a TensorFlow neural network design, create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.

Compile, train, and evaluate our binary classification model.

Final model loss metric
Final model predictive accuracy
Optimize our model training and input data to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

Create a new README.txt file within the same folder as our AlphabetSoupChallenge.ipynb notebook.

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
